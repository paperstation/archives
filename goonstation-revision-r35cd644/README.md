We will be continuing to develop Goonstation as a closed-source project. Maintaining both this source tree and our private one would be more of an investment in terms of time and effort than we are willing to undertake. PRs to this repository will be automatically closed.

If you wish to contribute to Goonstation, and would like to submit patches, bugfixes, or other source code improvements, please visit the [Patches subforum](http://forum.ss13.co/forumdisplay.php?fid=30) at [ss13.co](http://forum.ss13.co).
